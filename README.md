# express-skeleton

## This is my Express project skeleton.

It is a template which has some dependencies and devDependencies installed. It also contains some files and folders structure.

## How to use

### 1. On GitHub:

- Use this template
- Rename the new repo

### 2. Locally

- git clone <your-new-repo-url>
- cd <your-new-repo-url>
- npm install
- npm run dev

😎 Now you have a new repo with the same files from the skeleton, but with it's own history.

## What is missing?

### Things you might want to install later, depending on what type of project you're doing.

- bcrypt (password hashing)
- msql2 (database)
- swagger (jsdoc)
- zod (schema validation)
- jwt (authenticate accessToken. Json web token)
